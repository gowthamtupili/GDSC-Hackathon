# GDSC-Hackathon
This is the repo for Vashisht Hackathon conducted by GDSC and CS club of **Team mess-aih**.
<br>
**Problem statement and solution**
Our idea is to suggest the less crowded floor to a student who wants to go to the mess in any college.
We are collecting the data of the number of students from the biometric attendance in each floor.If we take another
biometric scan while going out, then we know the real-time data of the number of people in each floor.
With this data we can suggest a floor to a student who wants to visit the mess.
Tech stack: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.
